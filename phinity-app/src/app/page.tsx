          <p>
            We are Phinity Labs, a company that unlocks an improvement flywheel for companies building with LLMs and agents. 
            To do this, our first goal is to help companies understand how their agent behaves in the wild. 
            We're launching our first product - <span className="text-black font-normal">Replay</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our infrastructure captures every production interaction with your agentâ€”every prompt, every response, 
            every failure. When you ship new tool or prompt, we replay thousands of curated user scenario edge 
            cases against your changes. These replays generate actionable insights about what breaks, why it breaks, 
            and which users would be affected. The test suite evolves with your users' patterns, growing from 
            hundreds to thousands of real-world edge cases without any manual test writing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your worst production incidents become your strongest regression tests and your angriest users become 
            your best QA team, so you don't ship the same bug twice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Teams using Replay ship faster because they know exactly what will break before pushing to 
            production. We eliminate the gap between how developers think agents work and how users actually 
            experience them.
          </p>
